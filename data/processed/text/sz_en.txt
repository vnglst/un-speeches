KINGDOM OF ESWATINI

NATIONAL STATEMENT
BY

HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME
MINISTER, RUSSELL MMISO DLAMINI DURING THE 79™
SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL
ASSEMBLY

NEW YORK, USA

27™ SEPTEMBER 2024

Your Excellency, Mr. Philemon Yang, President of the
79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,

Your Majesties,

Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
The United Nations Secretary-General,
Honourable Delegates,

Ladies, and Gentlemen,

INTRODUCTION

Mr. President, it is with profound gratitude and a deep sense
of responsibility that I stand before you today at this pivotal
gathering of the 79" United Nations General Assembly.

I bring you the warmest greetings from His Majesty King Mswati
III, the Queen Mother, Government, and the People of the
Kingdom of Eswatini, who regrets not being able to attend this
Assembly due to pressing national commitments.

We are convened here not merely as representatives of our
nations but as stewards of a shared global community, united in
our commitment to peace, security, and sustainable

development.

As we gather under the theme, "Leaving No One Behind:
Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace,
Sustainable Development, and Human Dignity for Present
and Future Generations", we are reminded of our shared duty

to create a world where every individual has the opportunity to
thrive. Our obligation is to leave this planet in a better place for

our posterity.

The Kingdom of Eswatini joins this global Assembly with
unwavering dedication to the principles of peace, sustainable
development, and human dignity. We recognize that the
challenges we face today—marked by unprecedented crises—are
deeply interconnected.

It is only through collective action, innovation, and a firm
commitment to multilateralism that we can forge a path towards

a more just and equitable world.

Summit of the Future: A Historic Opportunity

We commend the Secretary-General for convening the recently
concluded Summit of the Future, which has provided a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate multilateralism, enhance global

solidarity, and reform our international governance structures.

Eswatini fully supports the Summit and its outcomes, as they
resonate with our belief in a fairer and a more inclusive world.
Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 there are
concerns that it’s no longer addressing adequately the issues
faced by the global community.
There is a need to reconsider the operations of the multilateral
institutions such as the IMF and World Bank and particularly the
Security Council.

The Kingdom of Eswatini stands by its efforts to call for reforms
in the United Nations. In 2005, we hosted the African Union
meeting that resulted in the Ezulwini Consensus, which
articulated Africa’s common position on the reform of the UN,
including the call for greater African representation on the
Security Council.

While it has taken nearly two decades for this conversation to
advance, Eswatini is proud of her early role in championing this
cause. We urge the global community to implement these long-
standing commitments and ensure that all regions and peoples

have a voice in shaping our collective future.

Accelerating Progress: The Spirit of Nkwe

Mr President, in Eswatini, we have embraced the spirit of
"Nkwe," which means "run." This national ethos symbolizes our
collective resolve to accelerate progress towards achieving the

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

It is a call for urgent action, for picking up the pace, and for
ensuring that every effort is made to meet the needs of our

people and our planet.
With only a few years left until 2030, time is not on our side. We
must double our efforts to bridge the gaps in development,
combat poverty and inequality, and address the climate crisis.
Nkwe is our rallying cry to run faster, to work harder, and to leave
no one behind. We invite the global community to join us in this
accelerated drive towards a better future for all.

Youth Empowerment: Investing in the Future

Africa is the youngest continent in the world, brimming with
potential and promise. The Kingdom of Eswatini is committed to
harnessing this demographic dividend by investing in our youth.

Our Youth Empowerment Programme, supported by
Government, the UN in Eswatini and other friends of the
Kingdom, aims to equip young people with the skills and
resources they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world. We
believe that by creating opportunities for employment and
entrepreneurship, we are laying the foundation for a more

prosperous and inclusive society.

Addressing youth unemployment and providing our young
people with meaningful opportunities is not just an economic
imperative but a moral one. We must act now to ensure that our
youth can participate fully in building the Africa we want, an
Africa of peace, prosperity, and dignity.
Poverty Eradication and Social Protection

Poverty remains one of the greatest challenges facing our
continent. In Eswatini, we are committed to eradicating poverty
through inclusive growth and_ robust social protection

programmes.

We have prioritized policies that provide safety nets for the most
vulnerable in our society, including women, children, and

persons with disabilities.

We urge the international community to support these efforts by
promoting fair trade, increasing development assistance, and
fostering partnerships that create jobs and uplift communities.
Let us work together to build a world where no one lives in
poverty, and every person can achieve their full potential.

Sustainable Development

Mr. President, Sustainable development is not a choice but a
necessity for the survival and prosperity of our planet. The
Kingdom of Eswatini remains dedicated to advancing our
development agenda as aligned with the 2030 Agenda for

Sustainable Development.

We have made significant strides in promoting poverty
eradication, renewable energy, the protection of our natural
resources, and ensuring equitable access to education and

healthcare for all Emaswati.
Our National Development Strategy aligns with global
development goals, focusing on economic diversification,

poverty reduction, and human capital development.

We have taken significant steps to promote renewable energy
through investments in solar, wind, and hydropower projects,
such as the Eswatini Electricity Company’s initiatives to increase
the share of renewable energy in the national grid.

These efforts are complemented by our progress in providing
access to quality education through the Free Primary Education
program and improving healthcare services as outlined in our

National Health Strategic Plan.

However, as a small, middle-income country, we face unique
challenges, including limited access to international financing,
vulnerability to climate change, and economic shocks. We call on
the international community to support the developmental
aspirations of countries like Eswatini, ensuring that our path
towards sustainable development is not hindered by structural
inequalities in the global system.

In response to these challenges, Eswatini has put forth a
comprehensive SDG Recovery and Acceleration Plan, valued at
over E30 billion (about US$ 1.6 billion), covering diverse areas
including digital transformation, renewable energy, agriculture,

industrial expansion, and social protection.

This plan prioritizes implementation over the development of
new frameworks, emphasizing sectors such as job creation—
specifically under SDG 8, target 8.5, which focuses on creating
jobs across industries as a multiplier for achieving other SDGs.

By investing in employment opportunities, we believe we can
address multiple dimensions of development, including reducing
food insecurity, enhancing access to essential services, and

minimizing social ills like crime and substance abuse.

Financing Sustainable Development
The implementation of the SDGs requires substantial financial
resources. However, many developing countries, including those

in Africa, face significant barriers to accessing affordable finance.

The current global financial architecture is not fit for the purpose
and must be reformed to make the financing more accessible
and equitable. We call for the implementation of the Addis Ababa
Action Plan, which emphasizes the need for innovative financing

mechanisms and global solidarity.

We also urge the international community to support the reform
of global financial mechanisms that have seen developing

countries pay much higher costs than developed nations to
access the much-needed funds. This unfair practice must end.
The Summit of the Future provides a critical opportunity to
address these disparities and ensure that all nations have the
means to achieve their development goals.

Promoting Peace and Security

Mr President, peace is the foundation upon which sustainable
development and human dignity rest. The Kingdom of Eswatini,
guided by its long-standing tradition of peaceful coexistence,
continues to advocate for dialogue and peaceful resolution of
conflicts. We condemn all forms of violence and support efforts
aimed at silencing the guns across the world, particularly in

Africa.

We call upon the international community to support the African
Union's Agenda 2063 and the AU Master Roadmap for Silencing
the Guns. It is imperative that if we are not to leave anyone
behind, we must address the root causes of conflict, including
poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity, which drive
instability and undermine development efforts.

Health Challenges

Mr. President, health is a fundamental pillar of sustainable
development, and its challenges are multidimensional, impacting
not just individual well-being but also national productivity and
social stability.
The Kingdom of Eswatini recognizes that achieving universal
health coverage is integral to the broader agenda of "Leaving No
One Behind." Despite our efforts to improve healthcare access
through initiatives such as the National Health Strategic Plan and
investment in health infrastructure, Eswatini, like many other
countries, continues to grapple with significant health
challenges.

These include a high burden of communicable and non-
communicable diseases, inadequate health financing, and the
complexities of delivering equitable healthcare in rural and
remote areas. Furthermore, the ongoing threat of pandemics,
such as COVID-19, and emerging health threats, such as the M-
Pox, exacerbated by climate change, underscore the need for
adequate preparedness and resilient health systems.

We call upon the _ international community to support
collaborative efforts in strengthening health systems, enhancing
disease surveillance, improving access to essential medicines,
and building capacity for rapid response to health emergencies.
Only through such global solidarity and shared commitment can
we ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages, as
enshrined in SDG 3.
Climate Action and Environmental Sustainability
Mr President, climate change poses an existential threat to our
future. In Eswatini, we have taken decisive steps to address this

crisis.

We have developed a comprehensive strategy to mitigate and
adapt to the impacts of climate change, investing in renewable
energy, sustainable agriculture, and disaster risk reduction.

We are also proud to announce that Eswatini has recently
adopted a ban on single-use plastics. This decision, supported
by UNDP and the Eswatini Environment Agency through
initiatives like "Phatsa Sakho Nawe," is part of our broader

commitment to environmental sustainability.

However, our efforts alone are not enough. We call upon
developed nations to honour their commitments to climate
finance and technology transfer. It is only through collective

action that we can ensure a sustainable future for all.

Mr. President, the theme of this year’s UN General Assembly is
“Leaving no one behind: “acting together for the advancement
of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for
present and future generations”, Ironically Taiwan and its 23.5
million people continue to be left by the United Nations and its
specialized agencies.
We wish to make a call for their inclusion, they need to be a part
of this global platform so that they can also fully participate in
the global development and growth of our goals.

Conclusion

Mr. President, the road ahead is fraught with challenges, but it
is also filled with hope and opportunity. Let us seize this moment
to reaffirm our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations
and to the vision of a world where peace, sustainable
development, and human dignity are realities for all. The
Kingdom of Eswatini stands ready to work with all nations in this

noble endeavour.
May we all embrace the spirit of Nkwe, and let us run together
with accelerated speed towards our shared goals, and ensure

that no one is left behind.

I thank you all.
