Mr President, Mr Secretary General, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,
1. Introduction and Overview

As the President of the Republic of Nauru, a small island nation with a vision
for a more equitable and sustainable future, | bring you warm greetings from
the Government and the people of Nauru.

In this 79" session of the United Nations General Assembly, we gather at a
time of unprecedented global challenge and opportunity. As we navigate the
complexities of the 21% century, Nauru remains committed to the principles
of sovereignty, self-determination, and international cooperation that have
guided our collective progress since the UN’s founding.

2. Ocean Resources

Mr President,
As a nation surrounded by the ocean, Nauru has a vested interest in the
responsible stewardship of the ocean’s marine resources. We have been at
the forefront of international efforts to protect and sustainably use the
ocean’s resources, including developing and adopting the BBNJ Agreement
and exploring the wealth of the deep seabed’s mineral resources in line with
our objectives under the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy.

The greatest risk we face is not the potential environmental impacts of
mineral recovery but the risk of inaction. There is a risk of failing to seize the
opportunity to transform to renewable energy and decarbonize our planet.
We cannot let fear and misinformation hold us back. Instead, we must use
the knowledge we have gathered wisely to ensure that deep-sea mineral
recovery, under the principle of the common heritage of humankind, does not
compromise the integrity of our marine environment. This is not just an
economic opportunity; it is an environmental imperative.

We, therefore, call on the international community not to ignore the science
and progress we have made. Instead, we urge you and the International
Seabed Authority Council to work with us to establish and adopt robust
regulations necessary for the conservation and sustainable use of marine
resources. We have the science, we have the technology, and we have the
imperative. Let us rise to the challenge and opportunity before us, employing
our advancements for the good of all, and let the time for action be now.

3. Resilience & Adaptation | Financial Challenges and Calls for
Reform | Banking | MVI

Mr President,

Nauru’s story is not one of despair but of resilience. Our people have thrived
for centuries, living in harmony with the land and the sea. Today, we adapt,
we innovate, and we persevere. We are exploring new frontiers because
even as we fight against the effects of climate change, we must also adapt
to the reality that is upon us. Through initiatives like the Higher Ground
Project, we are reclaiming land, strengthening our infrastructure, and
securing our future.

Adaptation initiatives to address modern challenges and concerns demand
more than technical expertise; they require substantial financial resources
which is an ongoing struggle. When it comes to climate finance, we are too
often relegated to the back of the queue.

We must also address the critical issue of access to basic financial services.
For nations like Nauru, equitable access to banking is not merely a
convenience—it’s a lifeline. Yet, we face the growing threat of de-risking and
the loss of correspondent banking relationships. This challenge transcends
financial concerns; it strikes at the heart of our sovereignty and dignity.

Our nation’s struggles cannot be measured by income alone. We are
vulnerable in myriad ways, and the global financial system must evolve to
reflect this complex reality. We are encouraged by the recent adoption of the
multidimensional vulnerability index (MVI) and we further call upon the World
Bank, IMF, IFl and MDBs to integrate the MVI, into their frameworks. It is not
just another statistic. It is a tool that provides a more accurate picture of our
national circumstances—our strengths, our challenges, our potential.

4. China
Mr President,

One of the most pressing issues of our time is the rising tensions between
global powers. Nauru has long believed in the importance of maintaining
good relations with all nations, great and small alike—we are friends to all
and enemies to none, guided by our motto “God’s Will First.”

Our restored diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China are a
testament that even the largest and the smallest of countries can find
common ground and work towards mutual benefit. Nauru is proud of our
strong and growing friendship with China and we further commend their
recent agreement with Japan on the ocean discharge of Fukushima nuclear-
contaminated water. This historic accord represents a significant step
towards addressing a pressing issue of global concern.

5. Peace | Development
Mr President,

As a staunch friend, we continue to call for an immediate and unconditional
end to the decades-long embargo imposed on Cuba.

As we know, conflicts and tensions persist across many regions of the world.
In our shared pursuit of progress and prosperity, it is crucial to acknowledge
that conflict impedes growth and undermines community stability. Therefore,
we must intensify our efforts to foster peace and development free from the
shadow of conflict.

Let us reaffirm our commitment to building bridges of understanding,
nurturing empathy, and promoting reconciliation. We must understand that
peace and development are not separate entities but intertwined pillars of
human progress. Peace creates an environment where individuals can
thrive, communities flourish, and nations prosper. In the absence of conflict,
societies can better allocate resources to education, healthcare,
infrastructure, and sustainable economic growth—fostering the
advancement of all people. Let us work together towards a future where
everyone can live with dignity, harmony, and opportunity, leaving behind a
legacy of peace for generations. By prioritizing conflict resolution, we pave
the way for resilience, progress, and shared prosperity.

We must focus on building bridges, not walls, and work towards a more
integrated, connected world. Inclusivity and engagement are vital as we
strive for full economic and financial participation, ensuring that no country—
large or small, regardless of its development status—is left behind. This is a
call for collective action, a call we must all heed, for the sake of our shared
future.
The UN Security Council reform, long overdue, must reflect the geopolitical
realities of the 21% century. It is evident that the current structure of the UN
Security Council has been a subject of debate, with legitimate concerns
about representation, effectiveness, and the ability to address contemporary
security issues. The imperative for peaceful resolutions and pursuing lasting
peace in conflict-affected regions further underscores the critical need for a
reformed and strengthened UN Security Council. Let us be the leaders who
bring about a new era of peace and reconciliation.

In our pursuit against climate change, we continue to call on the UNSG to
appoint a Special Representative on Climate and Security. We are pleased
to endorse the call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we urge
countries to back this initiative for a sustainable and equitable future. We
also eagerly await the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice
on Climate Change and will closely follow and support the implementation of
the Court’s guidance in the pursuit of climate justice.

Nauru is pleased to welcome the Pact of the Future’s ambition yet we are
disappointed in the removal of Action 21. My delegation, alongside members
from the Group of Friends on Climate and Security, advocated for its
inclusion to address the security threats posed by the climate crises.
Removal of Action 21 was a non-negotiable issue. Despite our flexibility to
compromise, it is vital to stress the gravity of our decision.

6. Calls to Action
Mr President, before | conclude, | call on the following,

To the developed nations, we say: recognize your historical responsibility for
emissions and honor your obligations under the Paris Agreement. Provide
the climate finance and technology transfer you have promised. Support our
efforts to transition to renewable energy, to enhance our climate resilience,
and to protect our biodiversity.
To those who seek to block our efforts in sourcing renewable energy
resources, do not dismiss the potential of deep-sea minerals outright. Do not
ignore the science and the progress we have made. Instead, work with us to
establish the robust regulations necessary for responsible mining. In line with
this year’s theme, we must accelerate our efforts without delay because the
climate crisis will not wait for us to get our acts together.

To our fellow developing nations, we extend our hand in solidarity. Let us
share knowledge, resources, and solutions. Let us amplify our collective
voice, for in unity, there is strength.

And to the United Nations, we call upon you to fulfill your founding promise.
Be a bastion of multilateralism, the resolute champion of the vulnerable, and
the bold catalyst for the transformative change our world so desperately
need.

7. Conclusion
Mr President,

| conclude my remarks by reminding us that leaving no one behind is not a
mere platitude; it is a moral imperative. It is a call to action, a reminder that
our fates are intertwined and that the advancement of all, hinges on the
advancement of the least among us. This is the vision enshrined in the
United Nations Charter. This is the promise of the Sustainable Development
Goals

Nauru may be small in size, but our resolve is immense. We will continue to
fight for our homeland and our future generations. Let us act together, with

urgency, with ambition, and with the conviction that a better world is possible.

May God bless the Republic of Nauru and May God Bless the United
Nations.

Mwa Tubwa kor, | thank you.
Ends.
