Remarks at 79th Session of United Nations General Assembly
Prime Minister of St. Kitts and Nevis
Hon Dr Terrance Drew
September 27th, 2024

Mr President, Secretary-General Guterres, esteemed colleagues,
excellencies, my fellow citizens of our twin-island Federation of Saint
Kitts and Nevis, and friends from every corner of our shared planet.

Today, | rise on behalf of my small island developing state, and yet in
truth, | speak for the many small island nations—large ocean states—
that know too well the high cost of inaction. We are small, yes, but our
voices carry the weight of rising seas, thundering storms, and
livelihoods teetering on the edge of erasure. A sustainable future for
SIDS demands more from us all.

Let me begin by paying tribute to His Excellency Dennis Francis, whose
leadership and Presidency of the 78th session demonstrated the fierce
determination of the Caribbean. We stand ready to drive the changes
necessary for a sustainable, secure world. Thank you for your sterling
leadership, Mr President.

| must also acknowledge Secretary-General Guterres, who, with
unflinching resolve, has championed justice, equity, and hope. This past
year tested our commitment to peace and security, yet it also revealed
the vast opportunities we must seize if we are to steer humanity toward
a better way.

Mr. President, | congratulate you on your election as the President of
this 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly. We have great
confidence in your leadership as you guide us with the theme, “Unity
and diversity for advancing peace, sustainable development, and human
dignity, everywhere and for all.’

As we convene here in this hallowed hall, | recall the words of former
Secretary-General Kofi Annan: "The future of peace and prosperity that
we seek for all the world's peoples needs a foundation of tolerance,
security, equality, and justice." That foundation is fragile, but it is
essential. And it is crumbling under the weight of neglect, greed and
abuse of power.

Seventy-nine years ago, in the wake of war’s devastation, visionaries
sought to build a world where diplomacy and dialogue could triumph
over destructive intolerance. Yet, today, we stand on the precipice of a
perilous return to a world where peace is kept at gunpoint, where
weapons are romanticized, and violence is exalted in the pursuit of
absolute power.

We need more than diplomatic platitudes. We need a humanity
steeped in decency, justice, equity and inclusivity. We must rise from
these chambers, not resigned to the idea that the children of Haiti,
Congo, Sudan, and Palestine are less deserving of the rights and
freedoms that we enjoy. We are all one people, one world. We cannot
have peace without justice, nor justice without true, solid equality.

In the Caribbean, our lived reality is of rising tides washing away our
hopes, of unforgiving heat setting ablaze our dreams. We pray for rain
and receive the flood, dragging our homes and our future to the abyss.

When the guns flood our communities, tearing children from their
mothers’ arms, it is a collective cry for action.

When the Global South starves while food wastage continues unabated,
we must be shaken from our complacency.

The harsh truth is that the world is becoming mortally insecure. We
stand on disappearing shores. We are besieged by storms natural and
man-made. Corporate greed, colonial arrogance, and unchecked
consumerism have torn apart our social contract with each other. We
are no longer at peace with Nature.

The greatest delusion we feed ourselves is that security and
sustainability are separate endeavours. They are, in fact, intertwined.
We cannot build secure nations while allowing the climate crisis to rob
future generations of their birthright. Security is more than an absence
of conflict; it is the presence of dignity, of justice, and hope.

Generations ago, the Labour Movement in Saint Kitts and Nevis paved
the way for our people’s emancipation—an emancipation built on the
principles of social, economic, and human dignity. Today, | echo their
call: We must DO better. We must BE better. Our ambitions must be
grander, our vision clearer.

When we say, “leaving no one behind: acting together for the
advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity

Page 3 of 10
for present and future generations” it cannot be a hollow phrase. It
must be a sacred commitment —a pledge to every soul, from the
wealthiest nation to the smallest island state. For when the waters rise
in the South, even the North will eventually drown. When the forests
burn in the North, the South too will choke from the smoke. For it is one
Planet; one Human Race.

The pandemic has left scars that still fester, and global economic
fragmentation threatens to deepen the divides between us. For small
island states like mine, the failure to meet these goals is not just a
disappointment; it is a death sentence. The clock is ticking, and we
cannot afford to wait any longer.

Today, the Caribbean braces for an intense hurricane season, facing the
escalating fury fueled by warming oceans and unprecedented storms.
Our brothers and sisters in Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique,
and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, are still recovering from the
devastation of Hurricane Beryl, which became the earliest-formed
Category Five hurricane on record this past July. In the Pacific, our
colleagues remain exposed to the incessant battering of typhoons that
ravage their islands. And as | speak, the southeast United States is being
pounded by hurricane Helene. Lives and livelihoods hang in the
balance, as entire communities brace for the next assault.

Hoteliers in my own country of Saint Kitts and Nevis have approached
our government, stating with a sense of dread, that they may soon no
longer be able to market themselves as beach resorts. Our famous
beaches, once the lifeblood of our tourism-driven economy, are steadily
disappearing under the relentless rise of the sea. The sands that once
beckoned visitors from across the globe are now receding, swallowed

Page 4 of 10
by seas which continue to rise. The loss will be irreversible if we do not
act.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were meant to shield us
from such devastation, offering a progressive agenda to build resilience
and safeguard our citizens. Yet despite their promise, according to the
UN’s 2024 SDGs Report, only 17 percent of the targets are on track.
Nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress, and over one-
third have stalled or even regressed. The clock is ticking, and we must
do more than observe its passage—we must act before these realities
become permanent fixtures in our collective future.

In May 2025, the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis will proudly co-host
the Global Sustainable Islands Summit with Island Innovation, a pivotal
event dedicated to advancing sustainable development on _ islands
across the globe. Titled "Sustainable Future for Island
Communities," this summit will build on the momentum of the SIDS4
Conference held in 2024, tackling the pressing challenges island nations
face. This summit will be a call to action, a space where we shape
practical solutions and partnerships that ripple far beyond our shores.
Our islands are the sentinels of climate change and the proving ground
for sustainable development. It is with this spirit of shared responsibility
and urgent action that | extend a heartfelt invitation to all leaders of
island nations gathered here to come, to engage, and to commit to
meaningful change.

A recent and commendable stride toward equity and inclusion has been
the adoption of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI). This
serves as a powerful testament to the potential of multilateralism when
it is both purposeful and effective. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands with the
Caribbean Community and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in
welcoming resolution 78/322, while urging this esteemed body to rally
the necessary political will and resources to drive its implementation
across international financial institutions and multilateral development
banks.

For us small island developing states, the MVI is not just another metric;
it is a lifeline, offering a means to cushion the relentless blows of
climatic and economic crises that disproportionately affect us. Its full
implementation will demonstrate to the world that the United Nations,
and by extension the global system, remains committed to uplifting
those most vulnerable. It will restore trust in a system that must not
only recognize vulnerability but actively work to address it.

The time has come to reshape the United Nations, to reform its
structures so that they reflect the realities of our modern world. Too
many voices remain unheard, too many nations marginalized. The UN
Security Council must include representation from the regions most
vulnerable to the threats of our time—Latin America, the Caribbean,
and Africa.

Nowhere is this change more urgently needed than in the international
financial architecture. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands in solidarity with the
Government of Barbados in its fight for financial and climate justice,
pledging our full support for the Bridgetown Initiative. This bold
framework demands a reformation of global finance, making it more

Page 6 of 10
responsive to the unique vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing
States. We cannot build resilience without first ensuring that the
international system works for the most vulnerable among us.

In the Caribbean, we continue to call for and guard our zone of peace.
The Argyle Declaration serves as a shining example of how we in the
Caribbean manage security challenges. We go back to basics: we talk to
each other. Specifically, the Declaration has been instrumental in
facilitating dialogue between Venezuela and Guyana, demonstrating
that even the most complex disputes can be navigated through peaceful
means. This model of engagement—one of dialogue and cooperation—
is the very essence upon which this institution was founded. The
international community would do well to follow this approach and
inject new life into our diplomacy.

To this end, | reiterate CARICOM’s call for an unconditional ceasefire in
Gaza, to put an end to the suffering. The only pathway to peace and to
secure fundamental human rights and dignity is through the two-state
solution.

As we face these global challenges, we cannot forget Haiti. Haiti, the
beacon of resilience and courage, stands at the crossroads of its next
chapter. Saint Kitts and Nevis, alongside the Caribbean Community,
firmly supports the work of the National Transitional Council as it strives
to create an environment conducive to a multi-stakeholder political
solution. Haiti was there for the downtrodden of the world, lighting the
path toward freedom for many, and now the world must be there for
Haiti. Not because it is a place of sorrow, but because it remains a
symbol of human endurance and defiance against injustice. With the

Page 7 of 10
establishment of the Multinational Security Support Mission, the
Caribbean Community seeks to usher in a new day for Haiti’s families—
a day where schools become places of learning, hospitals are places of
healing, and markets are not arsenals for gangs, but havens for
community and prosperity. Haiti’s future is not only one of security but
one of sustainability, and we must rally to give it the peace it deserves.

Year after year, this body sends a strong message to the people of Cuba.
The embargo that has isolated Cuba for decades is illegal and continues
to be a stain on our collective conscience. Saint Kitts and Nevis joins the
Caribbean Community in calling for an end to this unjust embargo and
for Cuba’s removal from the State Department’s list of State Sponsors of
Terrorism. Cuba has long been a friend to the Caribbean, its doctors and
educators exemplifying true philanthropy. Instead of denigrating this
island, we should elevate and learn from its sustainable solutions that
have empowered their people and, in turn, the region. A stronger, more
sustainable Cuba enhances the security and sustainability of the
Caribbean.

In the same breath, we must not forget Taiwan. The people of Taiwan
have proven, time and again, their firm commitment to sustainable
development. The theme of this Assembly, "leaving no one behind,"
compels us to ensure Taiwan’s inclusion in the work of the United
Nations System, particularly in the World Health Organization and the
International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan’s leadership in
innovation and technology is not just an asset; it is a necessity for the
global community to meet the challenges of tomorrow. The United
Nations must extend its vision to include Taiwan, a nation whose
exclusion undermines the very principles we stand for: peace,
sustainable development, and human dignity.

Mr President, esteemed colleagues, Saint Kitts and Nevis stands before
you today, not seeking pity, but partnerships. We are on a
transformative journey to become the Western Hemisphere’s first
Sustainable Island State, guided by seven pillars: Water Security, Energy
Transition, Food Security, Sustainable Industry, Sustainable Settlements,
Circular Economy, and Social Protection.

We are taking bold, tangible actions:

Building renewable energy desalination plants for a reliable 24/7
water supply.

Aggressively advancing geothermal energy on our sister isle of
Nevis, with the goal of a unified, sustainable energy grid for both
islands.

Constructing our first, modern, climate-smart hospital.

Building climate-smart, affordable housing solutions, ensuring that
our people have a safe, sustainable place to call home.

Finalizing one of the Caribbean's largest solar-plus-storage
projects.

We are on track to meet CARICOM’s 25 by 25 agenda, reducing
our food imports and bolstering local food production.

We created a Children’s Medical Fund to ensure that
disadvantaged families can access vital medical care for their
children abroad.

We continue to advance education beyond our universal,
compulsory system, promoting lifelong learning as key to national
development.

My friends, we stand at a crossroads. We can no longer afford the
luxury of inaction. We must meet the moment with the courage it

Page 9 of 10
demands. We must reject business as usual and embrace a new path
forward—one that values people over profit, one that prioritizes the
planet over power. As we gather in this assembly, let us remember: we
are all stewards of this fragile world. The rising tides do not respect
borders, and the fires of conflict burn without discrimination.

For Saint Kitts and Nevis, for the Caribbean, for every small island nation
whose future hangs in the balance—I ask you to stand with us. Let our
voices rise like the oceans that surround us, powerful and unyielding,
calling for a future where peace is not just the absence of war, but the

presence of justice, of sustainability, of hope.

Together, let us seize this moment and shape the future. Together, let us
stand proud and strong.

LET US ACT NOW!

Thank you.
