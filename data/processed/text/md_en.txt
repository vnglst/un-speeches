Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Excellencies,

It is an honour to represent my
country, the Republic of Moldova, at
this unique forum where small and
large nations alike address core
issues on the global agenda.
Climate change, poverty, and the
global cost-of-living crisis are our
generational challenges. So is
peace and security.

For some time now, It seemed we
were living in a rules-based
international system, which strongly
discouraged geopolitical conquests,
spheres of influence and disregard
for the aspirations of smaller
nations. The world proved to be a
much safer place when smaller
nations have a say and the choices
their people make are respected.

Peace, security, prosperity and free
choice is the core agenda for
Moldova today. Generations of our
Intellectuals, writers and civic
activists have fought for our
independence and for the freedom
to pursue our identity and values.
They have succeeded in making
Moldova free! After 33 years of
independence, we see it in the
confidence of our youth, in the
revitalization of our culture, and in
the way our people stand proud on
the international stage, knowing
their future lies in their own hands.

Very next to us, Russia's
unprovoked and unjust war of
aggression against Ukraine
threatens the fabric of our
international order. It throws us
back to the times of great power
politics, when a large state pursues
cynical geopolitical designs to
divide the region into spheres of
influence and annex smaller
neighbours, denying them a say in
their own destiny.

For Moldova, this is not a mere
distant memory - it is a looming
threat. Moldova knows all too well
the consequences, and we are
determined to never return to those
times. Don’t forget: Kremlin doesn't
want us at the table. Kremlin wants
us on the table. Never mind all the
excuses and the circumstances.
Compulsion and raw force are
perpetuated and complemented
now with hybrid warfare, malign
influence and subversion of the
democratic state. These latest
developments, Ladies and
Gentlemen, are threatening not only
Moldova. We see them escalating
throughout the democratic world.
Even mature democracies find it
difficult to cope with, witnessing
polarisation and division.

Therefore, Ukraine is now fighting
not just for its statehood, nation,
and its very existence. It is fighting
for each nation’s freedom to choose
and pursue its own national
aspirations. Moldova stands by and
in solidarity with Ukraine in defence
against Kremlin's aggression. And
we urge the international
community to timely provide all
necessary support to Ukraine.
Distinguished audience,

Despite the war at our border,
Moldova remains an active and
committed contributor to regional
security. We are a reliable partner
for our neighbours, Romania and
Ukraine, as well as the European
Union. We have preserved peace
and security in Moldova. At the
same time, we have supported
humanitarian efforts by welcoming
over 1 million Ukrainian refugees
and ensuring their safety. Peace is
not just our goal; it is our duty.
Peace remains our core
commitment.

Moldova is also committed to a just,
peaceful resolution of the
Transnistrian conflict, with full
respect for Moldova’s sovereignty
and territorial integrity within its
internationally recognized borders.
For this to happen, Russia's illegal
military presence must end. | call on
the international community to
reaffirm the need for the immediate
and unconditional withdrawal of the
Russian military from Moldova. This
is not just about Moldova; it is about
upholding international law,
safeguarding regional stability, and
ensuring that no country’s
sovereignty is compromised by
foreign military presence.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Moldova's destiny belongs to
Moldovans, not outside powers.
Kremlin’s efforts to suppress the
dignity and will of the people of
Moldova, through both internal
subversion and external
intimidation, have no place in the
21st century.

Despite our differences, we have
always taken big decisions as a
nation, together, and have proudly
reaffirmed our national dignity and
self-worth! The social compact of
our society is individual freedoms,
human rights, competitive elections,
and open society, not Kremlin's
satellite state.

Today our people are closer than
ever to fulfilling these aspirations!
We are full of hope and
determination. Hope for a
democratic, prosperous future in the
European family of nations, to
which we rightfully belong; and this
hope is firmly rooted in Moldova’s
collective achievements over the
past years. Determined to work
hard and tirelessly to become a
proud member of the EU’s peaceful
and prosperous family.

Moldova stands today stronger and
more united. Despite flooding
Moldova with illicit money,
propaganda and falsehoods, and
waging a fully-fledged hybrid attack,
Kremlin has failed to divide our
house against itself.

Moldova is no longer a “grey zone’,
a profitable money laundering
enterprise for unscrupulous
oligarchs and foreign powers, who
plundered the state and the people
and manipulated institutions for
their benefit. International sanctions
against these perpetrators helped,
and we are working to return the
stolen money.

Our commitment to reform is
unwavering, and we have made
progress in cleaning up its justice
system and law-enforcement. The
international community has
recognized these efforts, with
Moldova's corruption perception
and rule of law rankings improving
significantly.

We acted to make our economy
resilient, even in the face of regional
instability. Despite proximity to the
war zone, Moldova’s business
environment is improving, though
slowly. Small and medium
enterprises have a more promising
outlook, and exports of high-quality
products are picking up thanks to
Our access to European markets.
Moldova is going digital and is
bringing the government closer to
its citizens and businesses.

Over the past few years, more has
been invested in infrastructure than
over 10 years before that. Our
energy independence is now a
reality. Energy can no longer be
used to blackmail and extract
geopolitical concessions. Moldova's
energy security is ensured by its
integration in the regional and
international grids and markets. We
proceeded to a fast-paced agenda
of renewables and energy
efficiency.

Resilience is not just about security
—ijt is about our institutions, which
are stronger today than ever before,
thanks to the support received from
our partners. Institutions are better
prepared to safeguard the choices
of the Moldovan people from
external interference.

Crucially, Moldova has genuinely
opened itself to the world. In
recognition of the country’s
progress, in December of 2023, EU
leaders unanimously agreed to
Open accession negotiations with
Moldova. This is our most
significant achievement since
independence, and we are
committed to be ready to join the
EU by 2030.

Our European path is a matter of
vital national interest and our
strongest guarantee of peace,
democracy and development. On
October 20th, Moldova will reaffirm
its European choice in a
referendum to enshrine EU
integration into our constitution.

Russia may continue its attempts to
disrupt Moldova’s path through
threats, disinformation and
destabilisation to change the
sovereign choice of the Moldovan
people. They want to keep Moldova
captive in its past. But we, the
Moldovan people, are united in
determination. Only we can choose
our future. We will not return the
country to oligarchs, who plunder
the state and want to once again
turn the country into their personal
fiefdom, which yields massive
wealth to a few but fails the majority.
We will not return to a past
dominated by oligarchs and
corruption. We will not be dragged
back into a sphere of influence that
does not reflect our aspirations. The
people of Moldova choose freedom.
We choose Europe. And next month
we will reaffirm the goal of our
generation - fully-fledged
membership in the EU, a union
which has supported Moldova
throughout our independence.

And now a word on climate change.

Moldova has long been known for a
temperate, welcoming climate and
agricultural fertility. But just over the
past year, we have aced the most
severe weather extremes in our
history: devastating snowfalls,
unprecedented droughts and
heatwaves, and severe floods. They
Cause massive damages and
disruptions, like never before in our
history. These challenges are not
hypothetical - they are here, and
they threaten the livelihoods of our
farmers, economy, the infrastructure
of our villages and towns, and the
future of our children. Climate
change risks destroying many
things we heavily rely on throughout
the planet.

In this context, we welcome the
adoption of the Pact for the Future
by the United Nations General
Assembly. This is a significant step
towards building a more effective,
inclusive, and sustainable global
order. It reaffirms our collective
responsibility to future generations.
We are committed to working
alongside the international
community to turn these pledges
into concrete actions that will shape
a better, more resilient world.

As a final remark:

Moldova stands at a historic
crossroads, both as a nation and as
a member of the _ international
community. Moldovan people will
not allow it to be stripped of its
agency. Moldova chooses peace,
democracy, freedom and rule of law,
over war, authoritarianism, and
repression. For us this means
Europe. It is our choice, and it
strengthens our resolve to move
more decisively towards the EU - a
peace and prosperity project - while
rejecting war, aggression, and any
assault on human dignity.
Thank you!
