## Future work

- [x] Debug issues where Africa is often mentioned as a country (using AF which is for Afghanistan). GPT-4o might resolve this.
- [x] Debug issues where quotes are not being translated to English. GPT-4o might resolve this.
- [ ] Add about page, which is a modal that shows information about the project on visiting the page. It can be closed and opened again by clicking on the about button. It opens with a title "Are they talking about me!?" and then an intro what the Yearly General Assembly is all about. Then a brief description of how the analysis approach and how GenAI helped. Also includes a link to the GitHub repository.
- [ ] Add more information about the speeches. Included the earlier analysis of the 17 Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) mentioned in the reports. Then not a globe but graphs showing which goals are mentioned the most are interesting.
- [ ] Currently only the speeches of 2024 are included. Also add speeches from the past. This can be done by scraping the website of the United Nations.
- [ ] Also go back in time for the SDGs: showing how often goals are mentioned over time (since 2012) when they were introduced.
- [ ] Convert to Next.js so that sqlite queries can be run in the components (but still keeping the website static). This would allow my to do more with the data.
- [ ] Addings links to the speeches in the modal.
