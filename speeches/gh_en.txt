‘Leaving no one behind: Acting together for the advancement of
peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present
and future generations"

President of the General Assembly,
Secretary-General,

Excellencies, Heads of State and Government
Ladies and Gentlemen,

I cannot help but reflect on the significance of this moment, as this will be
my final opportunity to address the United Nations General Assembly, as I
enter the closing months of my presidency. Over the past eight years, I have
had the privilege of speaking on several variations of the essential themes
that, quite properly, dominate the deliberations of this global assembly — the
condition of humanity and the state of the planet. Serving the people of
Ghana, and by extension, those of West Africa, Africa, and the world, has
truly been the greatest blessing of my life. Mr. President, Ghana
congratulates you on your election to preside over the affairs of the 78"
Session of the General Assembly. You can count on Ghana’s support.

Indeed, being here this morning fills me with both pride and humility—pride
in the limited progress we have made together as nations, and humility in
recognising the challenges that still remain. My time as President has been
deeply fulfilling, and I am profoundly grateful for the trust placed in me by
my fellow Ghanaians. It has been an honour to serve them and to contribute
to advancing peace, security, and development on the global stage.

Mr President, I am here with a heart full of hope, yet mindful of the great
challenges that still confront us. As President of the Republic of Ghana, and
as a citizen of the world, I am acutely aware of the shared responsibility we
carry. Our work here is nothing less than shaping the future of humanity —
a future that will affect generations long after we are gone.

"Leaving no one behind: Acting together for the advancement of
peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present
and future generations" reminds us that the decisions we take here will
define whether we rise to meet the hopes of billions or continue to let
inequalities and injustices persist. We owe it to those who look to this body
for leadership to act, and not just to talk.

The world we live in today is a stark, unfortunate contrast of privilege and
hardship. For too long, the voices of those marginalised—those left behind—
have been drowned out. They constitute the bulk of humanity. These are
the voices of the poor, the displaced, the vulnerable. We cannot, in good
conscience, leave them behind. They should be at the centre of our
discussions and our decisions.

Africa, in particular, knows the cost of being left out. Yes, we are a continent
rich in potential and resilient in the face of adversity, but we have also been
disadvantaged by a global system that has generally treated us as an
afterthought. We have been viewed merely as passive recipients of aid,
rather than as equal partners in global progress. The well-meaning promises
of assistance have failed to materialise to bring about the long-term change
we so passionately need. Such aid, as is offered, often comes with strings
attached, limiting our ability to shape our own futures.

Africa is not a continent of despair, she is full of great possibilities. She is
required, however, to chart a new course of development. Our young
population is filled with energy, creativity and ambition. The people of Africa
are not asking for handouts—they are demanding opportunities in a new
global architecture so they can have access to education, healthcare and
jobs, to be able to build better lives for themselves, their families and their
descendants.

In Ghana, we have taken bold and decisive steps to ensure that no one is
left behind in our national development. We have shown that it is possible!
Our flagship Free Senior High School policy has benefitted five-point-seven-
million (5.7 million) young people, many of whom would have been denied
the opportunity to learn, to dream and to succeed. This initiative has
transformed the lives of millions, positioning the next generation of
Ghanaians to take their place as leaders in the global economy. But this is
just the beginning. We need a global commitment to ensure that every child,
no matter where they are born, has access to quality education. A world
where children are left unprepared for the challenges ahead is not a just
world.

Beyond education, we have also prioritised healthcare for our people.
Through Agenda 111, my government has embarked on the largest-ever
healthcare infrastructure project in Ghana's history. This initiative is
constructing one hundred and eleven (111) hospitals across the country,
ensuring that even the most remote regions have access to modern
healthcare facilities. This is part of our broader goal of ensuring that no one
in Ghana is left without the basic right to health.

We have also taken significant steps to boost food security and economic
growth through the Programme for Planting for Food and Jobs. This initiative
has improved food production, created jobs and enhanced incomes for
millions of Ghanaians. It is a clear demonstration that, with the right policies
and investments, we can transform our agricultural sector and ensure that
no one goes hungry. In the same vein, our 1-District-1-Factory policy is
transforming the industrial landscape of the nation, generating the structural
transformation of our economy, which is our major strategic objective.

In addition, Ghana has embraced, in full, the teachings of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, and is actively pursuing an agenda of digitilisation.
Under my administration, we have revolutionised public service delivery by
integrating technology into governance. From the introduction of the Ghana
Card, which has streamlined identification and access to services, to the
digitisation of the country’s land registry, these reforms have enhanced
transparency, efficiency, and accountability. Digitilisation has improved the
lives of ordinary Ghanaians, and has also laid the groundwork for sustainable
economic growth in the digital age.
And let us not forget the strides we have made in enhancing the rule of law
and governance. Through reforms in the judicial system, strengthening our
democratic institutions, and promoting transparency, Ghana continues to be
a beacon of good governance in Africa. We have enacted laws and
implemented policies that uphold the principles of accountability and ensure
that every Ghanaian, regardless of their background, is protected by the rule
of law.

Mr President, it is impossible to address the challenges of today without
speaking of the contradictions that exist within this global institution. We
gather here to discuss peace, but wars continue to ravage nations. We speak
of justice, yet injustice endures.

Take the Russian invasion of Ukraine, for instance. Millions of lives have been
uprooted, thousands have lost their lives, and, yet, the Security Council has
struggled to respond decisively, just as it is struggling to make a decisive
intervention in the tragic, ongoing war in Gaza. The structure of the Council
reflects a world that no longer exists, and its failure to act in times of crisis
raises a difficult question: what is the purpose of the Security Council if it
cannot intervene when the world needs it most?

Reforming the UN Security Council is a matter of fairness and necessity. The
current structure, created in 1945, no longer reflects the realities of today’s
geopolitical and economic landscape. Africa, Latin America, and South Asia
remain underrepresented, despite their significant influence on global affairs.
This lack of representation undermines the legitimacy of the Council’s
decisions, and the use of veto power by a few permanent members often
paralyzes its ability to act effectively during crises. Reform is essential to
ensure that the Council is more inclusive, democratic, and responsive to the
complex challenges we face today. The world has changed, and the Security
Council must change with it to maintain its relevance in promoting global
peace and security.

For years, I have championed the need to reform the Security Council as per
the Ezulwini Consensus, the Common African Position on UN Reform, which
calls for Africa to have a permanent seat on the Council. It is
incomprehensible that a continent of 1.4 billion people has no permanent
voice in shaping decisions that affect global peace and security. The time for

4
half measures is over. We need a Security Council that is fit for purpose in
today’s world. It is heartening, however, that, finally, the demand for Reform
has found acceptance by leaders of two (2) of the Five (5) Permanent
Members — President Joe Biden of the United States of America, and
President Emmanuel Macron of France. Hopefully, the others will soon follow
suit.

We must also recognise that the fight for peace goes beyond government
actions. It is a fight for humanity itself. In Africa, we have often borne the
brunt of conflicts, sending our troops to peacekeeping missions with limited
support from the global community. While I am pleased to see the UN taking
steps to finance peacekeeping in Africa, an outcome of Ghana's presidency
of the UN Security Council, we must go further. Peacekeeping alone is not
enough. We must address the potential causes of conflict—poverty,
inequality and lack of opportunity. True peace comes from investing in
education, healthcare and economic development.

However, peace cannot be imposed from the outside. It must be built from
within. African nations must take ownership of their security, and the African
Union needs to strengthen itself to be able to respond swiftly to threats.

Mr President, as I speak today, ongoing developments in West Africa are
deeply troubling. Military coups in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger
threaten the democratic progress we have worked so hard to achieve within
the ECOWAS Community. These coups are stark reminders that democracy
is, indeed, fragile and must be continually nurtured.

In Ghana, however, we remain resolute in our commitment to democracy.
As my presidency draws to a close, I want to assure this Assembly that the
upcoming 2024 elections in Ghana will be free, fair and transparent.
Ghanaians have demonstrated time and time again, in the last three (3)
decades, their strong attachment to democracy, which they will not permit
to be undermined. The Electoral Commission, supported by Ghana’s security
services, is well-equipped to ensure that the will of the Ghanaian people is
respected. Ghana has long been a beacon of democracy in Africa, and we
intend to keep it that way.
The people of Ghana, from every corner of the country, have made their
voices clear: they will not tolerate any attempts to disrupt the democratic
process. Ghanaians are deeply proud of their democratic heritage, and they
will protect it at all costs. The 2024 elections will be proof of our enduring
adherence to the rule of law, transparency and the principles of democratic
accountability that have guided our nation in recent decades.

Mr President, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in history. The decisions
we make today will shape the future of our world. We can choose to act with
courage, compassion and a commitment to leave no one behind — or we can
choose inaction, and allow the suffering of millions and the degradation of
the planet to continue.

Let me end by reminding us all that the future is not something that simply
happens—it is something we create. We have the power in this room to
change the course of history. Let us not shy away from that responsibility.
Let us act now, and let us act together.

I wish you God’s blessings in all your current and future deliberations.

I thank you for your attention.
