The Federal Republic of Somalia
Office of the Prime Minister

79° UN General Assembly
The Federal Republic of Somalia’s Address By Prime Minister
Hamza Abdi Barre 27" September 2024

Your Excellency, Philemon Yang, President of the 79th session of the United
Nations General Assembly,

Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Distinguished Representatives,
Ladies and Gentlemen, As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election
as President of the 79" session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Please be assured of Somalia’s full cooperation as you undertake the
responsibilities entrusted upon you during your tenure.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, H.E.
Dennis Francis, for the successful presidency of the last session.

Mr. President,

This Session of the General Assembly convenes amid a rising number of
global challenges — from escalating transnational conflicts and humanitarian
crises to the existential threats of climate change and growing economic
inequalities. Yet, with each of these challenges comes an opportunity for
transformation, an opportunity that can only be realized through closer
cooperation, collective resolve, and an unwavering commitment to the
principles of humanity and multilateralism. This resonates profoundly with
our theme this year, “leaving no one behind: acting together for the
advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for
present and future generations”.
Mr. President,

In the spirit of unity and shared responsibility, we must confront the persistent
and escalating conflicts that continue to cause immense human suffering and
destabilize entire regions. Today, we are faced with crises that test our
collective conscience and our commitment to peace.

In Sudan, the conflict has escalated into a severe humanitarian crisis,
displacing millions, and ravaging communities. Civilians endure
indiscriminate violence and widespread gender-based assaults. Food
insecurity is dire, with millions facing famine due to disrupted supply chains
and limited access to aid. The situation is worsened by political fragmentation
and failing governance, leaving many without essential services or support.
We urgently call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the protection of
civilians, and adherence to international humanitarian law. It's crucial to
ensure safe, unrestricted access for humanitarian aid and to foster
inclusive dialogue that respects the rights and aspirations of all Sudanese
people.

In Gaza, the situation has reached catastrophic levels, driven by the
persistent blockade and relentless cycles of violence that have created one of
the most severe humanitarian disasters of our time. Despite the senseless
killing of tens of thousands of men, women and children since last October,
over two million Palestinians are trapped in an open-air prison, where access
to basic goods, services, and medical care is severely restricted. The blockade
has systematically crippled Gaza’s economy, pushing the majority of its
population into abject poverty and leaving them reliant on scarce humanitarian
aid for survival. Children in Gaza have particularly suffered the most, with
many enduring unimaginable trauma, malnutrition, and a lack of access to
education and healthcare. They live under constant fear, as their homes,
schools, and hospitals are repeatedly targeted and destroyed. The ongoing
conflict has not only destroyed the physical infrastructure of Gaza but has also
crushed the hopes of an entire generation. The world cannot continue to
turn a blind eye to this gross injustice and the continuous violations of
international law by the Israeli government. We call on the international
community to take immediate and decisive action — to enforce an
unconditional ceasefire, to lift the inhumane blockade, and to recommit
to a political process that ensures a just and lasting peace based on the
two-state solution, thereby restoring the rights, dignity, and future of the
Palestinian people.
In Ukraine, the war, now in its third year, has inflicted a devastating toll on
civilians, destroying homes and critical infrastructure and leaving millions
without essential services. The legacy of trauma and displacement will affect
generations. We urgently call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, a
ceasefire, and adherence to international humanitarian and human rights
law, including avoiding attacks on civilians, critical infrastructure, and
nuclear facilities. It is essential to open channels for dialogue and achieve a
lasting political settlement. The international community must act swiftly to
prevent further escalation and support efforts for peace.

Mr. President,

While international crises demand our attention, we must not overlook
regional threats that directly challenge national sovereignty and stability.
Somalia currently faces a serious threat from Ethiopia’s recent actions, which
flagrantly violate our territorial integrity. Ethiopia’s attempts to annex parts
of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access are both unlawful and
unnecessary. Somali ports have always been accessible for Ethiopia’s
legitimate commercial activities, reflecting our commitment to regional trade
and cooperation. However, Ethiopia's aggressive maneuvers, including its
illegal MOU with a separatist group in Northern Somalia, undermine
Somalia’s sovereignty and

embolden secessionist movements, threatening our national unity.

These actions not only sow division at a time when Somalia is striving for
peace and cohesion but also serve as propaganda for terrorist groups like
Al- Shabaab, who exploit Ethiopia’s provocations to recruit and radicalize
vulnerable individuals. Such destabilizing behavior poses a significant risk
to the security and stability of the entire Horn of Africa.

Somalia asserts its sovereign right to defend its territorial integrity and
calls on Ethiopia to cease its provocations and adhere to international
law. We urge the international community to stand with Somalia in
condemning these violations and upholding the principles of national
sovereignty and territorial integrity, which are the cornerstones of
international peace and security. Regional stability depends on mutual respect
for these principles, and Ethiopia must be held accountable for actions that
threaten to destabilize the Horn of Africa.
Mr. President,

While conflicts may capture the headlines, we must not lose sight of other
pressing global challenges that demand our immediate attention and
collective action.

Somalia’s experience underscores the importance of sustainable funding for
peacekeeping. For over 15 years, we have hosted key African Union missions
like AMISOM and ATMIS, which have been critical in countering Al-
Shabaab and supporting state-building. As the 2025 security arrangement is
discussed in the Council, and AUSSOM is expected to take over with a focus
on counterterrorism and capacity-building, its success depends on reliable
funding. Peacekeeping is about creating lasting stability, not just maintaining
peace, and we urge the international community to support innovative
funding solutions to ensure these missions fulfil their vital roles.

Mr. President,

Climate change is a global crisis that touches every life and every
community, but nowhere is its impact more deeply felt than in vulnerable
nations like Somalia. We endure relentless droughts, devastating floods, and
rising temperatures that tear apart our communities and threaten our very
survival. While the recent COP28 conference made important strides with the
creation of a Loss and Damage Fund and commitments to expand renewable
energy, there remains a significant challenge: accessing these funds.

For many developing countries, the reality is that the complex bureaucracy,
rigid criteria, and lack of necessary resources often stand in the way of
receiving the help they so desperately need. It’s not just about making
promises; it’s about ensuring that those promises can reach the people who
need them most. We call on the global community to simplify access to these
critical funds, so that countries like Somalia can build resilience, protect our
people, and secure a future where everyone has the chance to thrive. The
stakes are too high, and the time for action is now.

Mr. President,

Reforming the United Nations Security Council is essential to ensure it
reflects today’s geopolitical realities. The current structure no longer
adequately represents the voices and concerns of the world’s nations,
particularly those in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We support the

4
Ezulwini Consensus, which calls for a more representative and inclusive
Council. This reform is necessary to enhance the UN’s credibility and
effectiveness in addressing the full spectrum of global challenges, from peace
and security to development and human rights.

Reforming International Financial Institutions is also crucial to building a
fairer global economy that promotes inclusive growth and _ sustainable
development. The existing international financial system is heavily skewed
in favor of a few, perpetuating inequalities and restricting the ability of
developing nations to thrive. We call for reforms that make these institutions
more accountable, transparent, and responsive to the needs of the world's
poorest and most vulnerable. Only through such reforms can we create a truly
inclusive and equitable global financial system that enables all nations to
share in the benefits of growth and development.

Mr. President,

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is not just an
ambition — it is a necessity. With only six years left, the world is far behind
on our collective promise to end poverty, protect our planet, and ensure peace
and prosperity for all by 2030. We must urgently renew our commitment by
increasing funding, creating innovative partnerships, and focusing on
reaching the most vulnerable. This will require political will and sustained
investment from every sector of society.

The recently concluded Summit of the Future has opened the door to new
opportunities and untapped possibilities through the adoption of the Pact
for the Future, the Global Digital Compact, and the Declaration on
Future Generations. These ground-breaking outcomes lay the foundation for
a sustainable, just, and peaceful global order, ensuring that all peoples and
nations can share in the benefits of a more inclusive and forward-looking
international system. Together, these agreements chart a path toward
cooperation that is responsive to the challenges of today and the needs of
future generations.

Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen

Somalia has come a long way on its journey toward stability and development.
This past year has been particularly significant, marked by critical milestones
that signal Somalia's rising trajectory. We have successfully completed the
debt relief process, allowing us to reclaim our economic sovereignty and

5
reintegrate into the global financial system. Additionally, Somalia's accession
to the East African Community marks a new era of regional integration,
trade, and cooperation. We have also made a historic stride in lifting the long-
standing arms embargo, a step that will further enable us to safeguard our
sovereignty and security.

Security is fundamental to development, and Somalia has prioritized the fight
against terrorism with remarkable success. In the past two years, our national
security forces, alongside the courageous efforts of our people, have reclaimed
more than two-thirds of the territory that was once under the control of the
Al-Shabaab terrorist group, significantly diminishing their operational
capabilities. Through targeted financial disruptions and a robust counter-
narrative campaign, we have also weakened their ideological grip and
undermined their sources of support.

Mr. President,

With marked progress in governance, democratization and political stability,
Somalia stands on the brink of significant economic growth, with vast
untapped resources and a strategic location along major maritime trade routes.
Our arable land offers great potential for agricultural production, and our
livestock sector is already among the strongest globally. We also have one of
Africa's highest potentials for renewable energy, particularly in onshore wind
power, and our extensive coastline provides rich opportunities for sustainable
fishing and other sectors of blue economy. To capitalize on these assets, we
are drafting a National Transformation Plan that outlines our vision for
leveraging our resources to achieve stability, self- reliance, and
prosperity. We welcome international investment and cooperation to help us
realize this potential, integrate into the global economy, and contribute to
regional peace and stability through strong partnerships.

Mr. President

As we look to the future, Somalia stands ready to play an active and
responsible role in the global community. As an incoming member of the
UN Security Council in 2025-2026, we are fully committed to working
alongside all nations to confront the world’s most pressing challenges.
Somalia is prepared to uphold international law, promote multilateralism, and
contribute to maintaining international peace and security.
The world stands at a critical juncture, and Somalia is prepared to engage in
shaping a future where collaboration prevails over division, and where the
dignity and security of every nation and community are upheld to shape
a more equitable and peaceful global order.

Let us work together with determination, building a future that is not only
peaceful but inclusive and resilient for generations to come.

I thank you for your attention.
