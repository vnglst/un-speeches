TO SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ANTONIO GUTERRES, | EXPRESS MY
COUNTRY'S DEEP GRATITUDE AND UNWAVERING SUPPORT FOR
YOUR EXCEPTIONAL WORK ON BEHALF OF HUMANITY, ESPECIALLY
AMIDST THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FACING MULTILATERALISM

ES
a

PANDEMIC, ESCALATING DEBT CRISES, AND THE IMPACTS OF

CLIMATE CHANGE.

IN YOUR ADDRESS TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, YOU HIGHLIGHTED
THE IMPORTANCE OF PEACE WITHIN COMMUNITIES, PEACE WITH
JUSTICE, PEACE WITH DIGNITY, AND PEACE WITH NATURE,
EMPHASIZING THAT BUILDING PEACE IS "HUMANITY’S GREATEST

RESPONSIBILITY."

THE UN WAS FOUNDED ON THE BELIEF THAT NATIONS CAN AND
SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE, AND WORK WITH EACH OTHER TO
RESOLVE CONFLICTS PEACEFULLY FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR
LIVES. IT ALSO ESTABLISHED THE FRAMEWORK FOR JUSTICE,
RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THE PROMOTION OF
GLOBAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AS THE UN CELEBRATES
ITS SEVENTY-NINTH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR, WE MUST REAFFIRM
THE ENDURING CONVICTION OF OUR FOUNDERS AND REASSERT

THEIR SENSE OF PURPOSE.
ES
a

AS | STAND HERE TODAY, | RESONATE WITH THESE SENTIMENTS,
DRAWING FROM OUR NATION'S HISTORY AND EXPERIENCES. THIS
YEAR, LESOTHO COMMEMORATES 200 YEARS SINCE THE FOUNDING
OF THE BASOTHO NATION, WITH THE PINNACLE OF THIS
CELEBRATION OCCURRING ON OCTOBER 4, 2024. WHAT, THEN, CAN
WE, AS A SMALLER NATION, CONTRIBUTE TO THE GLOBAL DISCOURSE

ON PEACE?
MR. PRESIDENT,

LESOTHO WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF PEACE, ‘KHOTSO’.
OUR FOUNDER; MORENA MOSHOESHOE 1, CHERISHED PEACE AS
ONE OF HIS CORE VALUES. WRITERS AND RESEARCHERS HAVE
DESCRIBED HIMAS "NO COMMON MAN, AS SOMEONE WHO STANDS
OUT CLEAR IN THE LIGHT, ORIGINAL, ABLE, ENLIGHTENED AND
UPRIGHT. HIS HUMANITY, HIS MILDNESS, HIS LOVE OF PEACE AND
JUSTICE, HIS HORROR OF WAR, HIS FORBEARANCE UNDER
EXTREME PROVOCATION, ARE CONSPICUOUS UPON EVERY

OCCASION.” THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT HAVE INSPIRED US AS

4
ES
a

BASOTHO. MORENA MOSHOESHOE 1 WAS ABLE TO BRING
TOGETHER DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUPS, AVERT CONFLICTS, AND
NEGOTIATE LASTING PEACE THAT TO THIS DAY, WE STRIVE TO
MAINTAIN. BASOTHO ARE A NATION BUILT ON TOLERANCE,
INCLUSION, AND UNITY, WHICH ARE ALSO THE KEY PRINCIPLES
ENSHRINED IN THE SECRETARY GENERAL’S NEW AGENDA FOR

PEACE.

IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT, THAT WE HAIL, AS MOST APPROPRIATE, THE
THEME CHOSEN FOR OUR GENERAL DEBATE THIS YEAR, NAMELY:
"LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND: ACTING TOGETHER FOR’ THE
ADVANCEMENT OF PEACE, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AND
HUMAN DIGNITY FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS". THE
RELEVANCE OF THIS THEME, AT THE PRESENT JUNCTURE IN
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, IS BEYOND DOUBT. THROUGH
COLLECTIVE ACTION, WE CAN CONQUER THE CHALLENGES FACING
HUMANITY AND REALIZE A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR
ALL. HOWEVER, THIS WILL REQUIRE LEADERS WITH HUMANITY,

MILDNESS, A LOVE OF PEACE AND JUSTICE, HORROR OF WAR, AND

5
ES
a

FORBEARANCE UNDER EXTREME PROVOCATION. THESE ARE IDEALS
THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED. MY ANCESTOR, AS TESTIFIED BY MANY,
WAS THE EMBODIMENT OF THESE TRAITS WHICH BUILT A NATION
THAT STANDS TO THIS DAY. BUSINESS AS USUAL WILL NOT
PRESERVE OUR WORLD AS WE KNOW IT. THE ENJOYMENT AND
EXERCISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ATTAINMENT OF SUSTAINABLE
PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRE A DELIBERATE FUNDAMENTAL
SHIFT AND COMMITMENT BY THE WORLD’S LEADERSHIP. IN THE
WORDS OF ANOTHER OF MY ANCESTORS, “ALWAYS BE SLOW TO
TAKE ARMS....AT ALL TIMES, | BESEECH YOU, LEAN UPON THIS ROD
OF PEACE. ALWAYS KEEP IT CLEAR IN YOURMIND THAT IT IS, FAR
MORE PROFITABLE TO HARVEST FOOD IN THE GRAIN FIELDS THAN
TO KILL MEN IN THE BATTLEFIELDS.”

IN TODAY’S RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD, THE UN HAS CONTINUED TO
FORGE PEACE IN CONFLICT-RIDDEN AREAS AROUND THE WORLD,
PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND LIFTING THOUSANDS OUT OF

POVERTY. LESOTHO REAFFIRMS ITS COMMITMENT TO ADVANCE THIS
ES
a

COLLECTIVE VISION OF AN EFFECTIVE UNITED NATIONS TO ENSURE

A PROSPEROUS AND A LASTING FUTURE FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE.
MR. PRESIDENT,

THE WORLD FACES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS THE DEADLINE FOR
ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)
APPROACHES. THE 2024 SDG REPORT INDICATES THAT ONLY 16% OF
THE TARGETS ARE ON TRACK TO BE MET BY 2030, WHILE 84% SHOW
LIMITED OR REVERSED PROGRESS. THE UNCTAD 2024 REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS A TROUBLING TREND WHERE 48 DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES SPEND MORE ON LOAN INTEREST PAYMENTS TO
DEVELOPED NATIONS THAN ON ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE
EDUCATION AND HEALTH. THIS ECONOMIC INEQUALITY DRIVES
MIGRATION, AS REFUGEES SEEK BETTER OPPORTUNITIES, OFTEN
LEADING TO XENOPHOBIA AND CONFLICT IN HOST COUNTRIES.
ADDRESSING THIS INEQUALITY IS CRUCIAL FOR FOSTERING
INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND ENSURING GLOBAL PEACE AND

STABILITY.
&
a

TO ENHANCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA, MY
GOVERNMENT PLANS TO PRESENT ITS THIRD VOLUNTARY NATIONAL
REVIEW ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN 2025. ACHIEVING THIS
GOAL REQUIRES STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS AND INCREASED
FINANCIAL SUPPORT, PARTICULARLY FOR VULNERABLE COUNTRIES

THAT ARE BOTH LEAST DEVELOPED AND LANDLOCKED.

THE CURRENT CRISES OF HUNGER, POVERTY, DISEASE, AND CLIMATE
CHANGE THREATEN TO REVERSE THE PROGRESS MADE OVER THE
LAST CENTURY. IN LESOTHO, CLIMATE CHANGE EXACERBATES
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, IMPACTING AGRICULTURE, WATER
RESOURCES, AND ENERGY SUPPLIES, LEADING TO FOOD
SHORTAGES WHICH HAVE COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO
DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN FOOD SECURITY. HOWEVER,
WE ARE COMMITTED TO RESPONDING TO THESE CHALLENGES BY
PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL ENABLE GREATER SELF-

SUFFICIENCY FOR THE COUNTRY.
&
a

LESOTHO’S STOCK IN TRADE IS A HIGH-QUALITY SUITE OF
RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES OF SUN, WIND, AND A PLENTIFUL
SUPPLY OF THE PUREST MOUNTAIN WATER. WE ARE THEREFORE IN
A POSITION TO ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND
WATERECONOMY. OUR PRIORITY IS TO SATISFY THE DEFICIT IN OUR
DOMESTIC ENERGY DEMAND AND TO EXPORT CLEAN ENERGY AND
HIGH-QUALITY WATER TO THE REGION. OUR GOAL TO FULLY MEET
COMMITMENTS TO THE PARIS ACCORD WELL IN ADVANCE OF 2050
WILL BE ATTAINED, WITH THE POTENTIAL OF LESOTHO BEING AMONG
THE FIRST COUNTRIES IN AFRICA TO BE A FULLY CARBON-NEUTRAL
ELECTRICITY GENERATOR. WE SEEK OUR OWN OPPORTUNITY TO

NAVIGATE OUR OWN WAY IN THIS COMPLEX WORLD.

IT IS ESSENTIAL TO RESTORE DIGNITY AND HOPE FOR WOMEN,
YOUTH, AND MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WHO CONTINUE TO
EXPERIENCE A DISPROPORTIONATELEVEL OF VULNERABILITIES AND
DISADVANTAGES. GENDER EQUALITY AND THE PROTECTION OF
WOMEN AND GIRLS FROM VIOLENCE ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN

RIGHTS THAT MUST BE PRIORITIZED. THE GOVERNMENT OF LESOTHO

9
ES
a

HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND LAWS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES
IN LINE WITH REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS.
ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO COMBAT DISEASES LIKE HIV/AIDS,
ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH 95% OF THOSE LIVING WITH
HIV KNOWING THEIR STATUS, 94% RECEIVING TREATMENT AND 98%
OF THOSE ON TREATMENT VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. SINCE 2010, WE
HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED NEW HIV INFECTIONS BY 74%,
DEMONSTRATING OUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL

EQUITY.
MR. PRESIDENT,

GLOBAL PEACE AND SECURITY ARE UNDER THREAT FROM
TERRORISM, ILLICIT ARMS FLOWS, ORGANIZED CRIME, CYBERCRIME,
AND FINANCIAL CRIMES, HINDERING PROGRESS TOWARDS
SUSTAINABLE PEACE. THIS WORRYING STATE OF AFFAIRS DEMANDS
COLLECTIVE AND RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROTECT GLOBAL PEACE,

SECURITY AND STABILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL HUMANITY.
&
a

MEDIATION HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN SAVING LIVES, MINIMIZING
RESOURCE COSTS, AND PREVENTING INFRASTRUCTURE
DESTRUCTION WHILE FACILITATING RECONCILIATION BETWEEN
OPPOSING PARTIES. DESPITE THE UN'S FOCUS ON PEACEFUL
DISPUTE RESOLUTION, POLITICAL TENSIONS AMONG MEMBER
STATES HAVE LIMITED ITS MEDIATION EFFORTS. IT IS THEREFORE
ESSENTIAL FOR THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO TAKE A PROACTIVE
LEADING ROLE IN THE MEDIATION OF DISPUTES. TO ACHIEVE THIS,
THE COUNCIL MUST ADOPT A MULTILATERAL APPROACH, AS
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY,
IMPARTIALITY, AND A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP OF THE MEDIATION
PROCESS BY THE WIDER UN MEMBERSHIP. FOR THIS REASON, WE
WARMLY WELCOME THE SECRETARY GENERAL'S NEW AGENDA FOR
PEACE, WHICH EMPHASIZES THE URGENT NEED TO REBUILD
MECHANISMS FOR MANAGING DISPUTES AND ENHANCING TRUST

AMONG MEMBER STATES AND REGIONAL FRAMEWORKS.

MR. PRESIDENT,
&
a

RESPECTING AND UPHOLDING HUMAN RIGHTS IS A FUNDAMENTAL
OBLIGATION OF ALL STATES, AS OUTLINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS
CHARTER. SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE ARE
ESSENTIAL RIGHTS THAT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL PEOPLE.
WE URGE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED NATIONS
RESOLUTIONS AIMED AT ENDING ALL FORMS OF COLONIALISM AND
OCCUPATION, PARTICULARLY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR THE

SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN SAHARA.

THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ESPECIALLY THE ONGOING
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN GAZA, REQUIRES URGENT ATTENTION.
WE RENEW OUR CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE, AS BOTH THE GENERAL
ASSEMBLY AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAVE REPEATEDLY
ADVOCATED FOR ONE. THE HIGH COST OF WAR IS A BURDEN
HUMANITY SHOULD NOT BEAR. WE BELIEVE IN A TWO-STATE
SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS TO COEXIST
PEACEFULLY AND SECURELY. GENUINE DIALOGUE AND MEDIATION,
RESPECTING THE RIGHTS AND CONCERNS OF BOTH PARTIES, ARE

CRUCIAL FOR RESOLVING THE PALESTINE QUESTION.
&
a

ADDITIONALLY, WE CALL FOR A MEDIATED SOLUTION TO THE
UNILATERAL COERCIVE MEASURES ON CUBA, AS THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMANDED THE LIFTING OF THE
ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL EMBARGO. CUBA, LIKE ALL MEMBER
STATES, DESERVES THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE FREELY IN
INTERNATIONAL TRADE, ANDWE ALSO REITERATE OURCALL FOR THE
LIFTING OF SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE.

MR PRESIDENT,

TO CONCLUDE WE WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE OUR BELIEF IN THE
PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY, RECOGNIZING THE SECURITY
COUNCIL'S PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. WE, THEREFORE, CALLFOR
GREATER AND MORE EFFECTIVE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE
COUNCIL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS OUTLINED IN CHAPTER
Vill OF THE UN CHARTER. THE STRENGTHENING OF THIS
COOPERATION IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SWIFT RESOLUTION OF

REGIONAL CONFLICTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL

13
ES
a

SHOULD BECOME MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF UN MEMBERSHIP TO
ENSURE ITS DECISIONS ENJOY GREATERLEGITIMACY. THEREFORE,
WE ADVOCATE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THE SECURITY
COUNCIL, SUPPORTING THE COMMON AFRICAN POSITION KNOWN AS
THE ‘EZULWENI CONSENSUS.’ WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE UN
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE A PLACE WHERE ALL OUR ASPIRATIONS
FOR A BETTER AND SECURE LIFE FOR HUMANITY MUST BE
CHAMPIONED. LET US WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD A UNITED
NATIONS THAT REFLECTS A BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG MEMBER
STATES, REINFORCING ITS CENTRAL ROLE IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE
AND FOSTERING COLLABORATION WITH REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

WHILE ENSURING ALL MEMBERS RESPECT ITS CHARTER.

| THANK YOU.
